# Masked Facial Recognition
2020/2021 HKUST CSE FYP Masked Facial Recognition, developer: Sam Yuen, Alex Xie, Tony Cheng

Supervisor: Prof. Dit-Yan YEUNG

This Github repository shows how to train a masked face recognition model. We use the masked facial recognition models to build a building security system in another [Github repository](https://github.com/SamYuen101234/BSMFR).
